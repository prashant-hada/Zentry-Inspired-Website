# Zenty-Inspired Website [ðŸ”—](https://zentry-inspired-project.netlify.app/)

This project is my take on recreating some of the beautiful sections and effects from **[Zenty.com](https://www.zenty.com)**. Iâ€™ve used **React** with **Vite**, along with **Locomotive Scroll** for smooth scrolling and **GSAP** for those sleek animations. Itâ€™s been a fun learning experience, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I did building it!.

## Features

-   Smooth scrolling with Locomotive Scroll.
-   Eye-catching animations that bring the site to life.
-   Modern and responsive design.

## Demo

Check out the project in action! Hereâ€™s a short video showcasing the recreated sections, animations, and smooth scrolling:
